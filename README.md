# Kodi Synology Download

This is an addon for the media center [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/).

Its goal is to be able to connect to a Synology NAS Download Station and see the current list of tasks there.

This is still very much a work in progress, so use it at your own risk!

More features / improvements will be added later, including :
- pausing / resuming a download task
- refreshing the window at regular intervals
- a less depressing UI
- unit tests
